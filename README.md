# Weather App

## Introduction 
Simple Weather App written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Feature
Weather App has a search bar that allows the user to insert any city of there choice and isntantly get the 
temperature and foreast in images. As an added feature user is able to see the forecasting for the next 24 
hours in intervals of 3 hours. Each interval shows the temperature, time and image of the forecasting. 

## How To Use
This weather app was designed with user expereince in mind. User can simply click on link to open it. Once 
opened user in prompted to enter a city in the search bar. If the user wants to change city they are easily 
able to reinsert a new city in the search bar at top of the screen.

## Future Plans
The weather app currently is in its simplest form which means it is currently only avaliable in Celcius. 
This choice came from Celcus being the most popular way of measuring temperature around the world. In future
plans I want to add a toggle switch to be able to switch from celcus to ferenheit.
